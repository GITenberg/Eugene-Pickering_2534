description: It was at Homburg, several years ago, before the gaming had been suppressed.
  The evening was very warm, and all the world was gathered on the terrace of the
  Kursaal and the esplanade below it to listen to the excellent orchestra; or half
  the world, rather, for the crowd was equally dense in the gaming-rooms around the
  tables. Everywhere the crowd was great. The night was perfect, the season was at
  its height, the open windows of the Kursaal sent long shafts of unnatural light
  into the dusky woods, and now and then, in the intervals of the music, one might
  almost hear the clink of the napoleons and the metallic call of the croupiers rise
  above the watching silence of the saloons.
