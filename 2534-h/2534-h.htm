<h1>EUGENE PICKERING<br />
by Henry James</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>It was at Homburg, several years ago, before the gaming had been
suppressed.&nbsp; The evening was very warm, and all the world was gathered
on the terrace of the Kursaal and the esplanade below it to listen to
the excellent orchestra; or half the world, rather, for the crowd was
equally dense in the gaming-rooms around the tables.&nbsp; Everywhere
the crowd was great.&nbsp; The night was perfect, the season was at
its height, the open windows of the Kursaal sent long shafts of unnatural
light into the dusky woods, and now and then, in the intervals of the
music, one might almost hear the clink of the napoleons and the metallic
call of the croupiers rise above the watching silence of the saloons.&nbsp;
I had been strolling with a friend, and we at last prepared to sit down.&nbsp;
Chairs, however, were scarce.&nbsp; I had captured one, but it seemed
no easy matter to find a mate for it.&nbsp; I was on the point of giving
up in despair, and proposing an adjournment to the silken ottomans of
the Kursaal, when I observed a young man lounging back on one of the
objects of my quest, with his feet supported on the rounds of another.&nbsp;
This was more than his share of luxury, and I promptly approached him.&nbsp;
He evidently belonged to the race which has the credit of knowing best,
at home and abroad, how to make itself comfortable; but something in
his appearance suggested that his present attitude was the result of
inadvertence rather than of egotism.&nbsp; He was staring at the conductor
of the orchestra and listening intently to the music.&nbsp; His hands
were locked round his long legs, and his mouth was half open, with rather
a foolish air.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are so few chairs,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;that I must beg you to surrender this second one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He started, stared, blushed, pushed the chair away with awkward alacrity,
and murmured something about not having noticed that he had it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an odd-looking youth!&rdquo; said my companion, who had
watched me, as I seated myself beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is odd-looking; but what is odder still is that I
have seen him before, that his face is familiar to me, and yet that
I can&rsquo;t place him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The orchestra was playing the
Prayer from Der Freisch&uuml;tz, but Weber&rsquo;s lovely music only
deepened the blank of memory.&nbsp; Who the deuce was he? where, when,
how, had I known him?&nbsp; It seemed extraordinary that a face should
be at once so familiar and so strange.&nbsp; We had our backs turned
to him, so that I could not look at him again.&nbsp; When the music
ceased we left our places, and I went to consign my friend to her mamma
on the terrace.&nbsp; In passing, I saw that my young man had departed;
I concluded that he only strikingly resembled some one I knew.&nbsp;
But who in the world was it he resembled?&nbsp; The ladies went off
to their lodgings, which were near by, and I turned into the gaming-rooms
and hovered about the circle at roulette.&nbsp; Gradually I filtered
through to the inner edge, near the table, and, looking round, saw my
puzzling friend stationed opposite to me.&nbsp; He was watching the
game, with his hands in his pockets; but singularly enough, now that
I observed him at my leisure, the look of familiarity quite faded from
his face.&nbsp; What had made us call his appearance odd was his great
length and leanness of limb, his long, white neck, his blue, prominent
eyes, and his ingenuous, unconscious absorption in the scene before
him.&nbsp; He was not handsome, certainly, but he looked peculiarly
amiable and if his overt wonderment savoured a trifle of rurality, it
was an agreeable contrast to the hard, inexpressive masks about him.&nbsp;
He was the verdant offshoot, I said to myself, of some ancient, rigid
stem; he had been brought up in the quietest of homes, and he was having
his first glimpse of life.&nbsp; I was curious to see whether he would
put anything on the table; he evidently felt the temptation, but he
seemed paralysed by chronic embarrassment.&nbsp; He stood gazing at
the chinking complexity of losses and gains, shaking his loose gold
in his pocket, and every now and then passing his hand nervously over
his eyes.</p>
<p>Most of the spectators were too attentive to the play to have many
thoughts for each other; but before long I noticed a lady who evidently
had an eye for her neighbours as well as for the table.&nbsp; She was
seated about half-way between my friend and me, and I presently observed
that she was trying to catch his eye.&nbsp; Though at Homburg, as people
said, &ldquo;one could never be sure,&rdquo; I yet doubted whether this
lady were one of those whose especial vocation it was to catch a gentleman&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; She was youthful rather than elderly, and pretty rather than
plain; indeed, a few minutes later, when I saw her smile, I thought
her wonderfully pretty.&nbsp; She had a charming gray eye and a good
deal of yellow hair disposed in picturesque disorder; and though her
features were meagre and her complexion faded, she gave one a sense
of sentimental, artificial gracefulness.&nbsp; She was dressed in white
muslin very much puffed and filled, but a trifle the worse for wear,
relieved here and there by a pale blue ribbon.&nbsp; I used to flatter
myself on guessing at people&rsquo;s nationality by their faces, and,
as a rule, I guessed aright.&nbsp; This faded, crumpled, vaporous beauty,
I conceived, was a German&mdash;such a German, somehow, as I had seen
imagined in literature.&nbsp; Was she not a friend of poets, a correspondent
of philosophers, a muse, a priestess of &aelig;sthetics&mdash;something
in the way of a Bettina, a Rahel?&nbsp; My conjectures, however, were
speedily merged in wonderment as to what my diffident friend was making
of her.&nbsp; She caught his eye at last, and raising an ungloved hand,
covered altogether with blue-gemmed rings&mdash;turquoises, sapphires,
and lapis&mdash;she beckoned him to come to her.&nbsp; The gesture was
executed with a sort of practised coolness, and accompanied with an
appealing smile.&nbsp; He stared a moment, rather blankly, unable to
suppose that the invitation was addressed to him; then, as it was immediately
repeated with a good deal of intensity, he blushed to the roots of his
hair, wavered awkwardly, and at last made his way to the lady&rsquo;s
chair.&nbsp; By the time he reached it he was crimson, and wiping his
forehead with his pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; She tilted back, looked
up at him with the same smile, laid two fingers on his sleeve, and said
something, interrogatively, to which he replied by a shake of the head.&nbsp;
She was asking him, evidently, if he had ever played, and he was saying
no.&nbsp; Old players have a fancy that when luck has turned her back
on them they can put her into good-humour again by having their stakes
placed by a novice.&nbsp; Our young man&rsquo;s physiognomy had seemed
to his new acquaintance to express the perfection of inexperience, and,
like a practical woman, she had determined to make him serve her turn.&nbsp;
Unlike most of her neighbours, she had no little pile of gold before
her, but she drew from her pocket a double napoleon, put it into his
hand, and bade him place it on a number of his own choosing.&nbsp; He
was evidently filled with a sort of delightful trouble; he enjoyed the
adventure, but he shrank from the hazard.&nbsp; I would have staked
the coin on its being his companion&rsquo;s last; for although she still
smiled intently as she watched his hesitation, there was anything but
indifference in her pale, pretty face.&nbsp; Suddenly, in desperation,
he reached over and laid the piece on the table.&nbsp; My attention
was diverted at this moment by my having to make way for a lady with
a great many flounces, before me, to give up her chair to a rustling
friend to whom she had promised it; when I again looked across at the
lady in white muslin, she was drawing in a very goodly pile of gold
with her little blue-gemmed claw.&nbsp; Good luck and bad, at the Homburg
tables, were equally undemonstrative, and this happy adventuress rewarded
her young friend for the sacrifice of his innocence with a single, rapid,
upward smile.&nbsp; He had innocence enough left, however, to look round
the table with a gleeful, conscious laugh, in the midst of which his
eyes encountered my own.&nbsp; Then suddenly the familiar look which
had vanished from his face flickered up unmistakably; it was the boyish
laugh of a boyhood&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; Stupid fellow that I was, I
had been looking at Eugene Pickering!</p>
<p>Though I lingered on for some time longer he failed to recognise
me.&nbsp; Recognition, I think, had kindled a smile in my own face;
but, less fortunate than he, I suppose my smile had ceased to be boyish.&nbsp;
Now that luck had faced about again, his companion played for herself&mdash;played
and won, hand over hand.&nbsp; At last she seemed disposed to rest on
her gains, and proceeded to bury them in the folds of her muslin.&nbsp;
Pickering had staked nothing for himself, but as he saw her prepare
to withdraw he offered her a double napoleon and begged her to place
it.&nbsp; She shook her head with great decision, and seemed to bid
him put it up again; but he, still blushing a good deal, pressed her
with awkward ardour, and she at last took it from him, looked at him
a moment fixedly, and laid it on a number.&nbsp; A moment later the
croupier was raking it in.&nbsp; She gave the young man a little nod
which seemed to say, &ldquo;I told you so;&rdquo; he glanced round the
table again and laughed; she left her chair, and he made a way for her
through the crowd.&nbsp; Before going home I took a turn on the terrace
and looked down on the esplanade.&nbsp; The lamps were out, but the
warm starlight vaguely illumined a dozen figures scattered in couples.&nbsp;
One of these figures, I thought, was a lady in a white dress.</p>
<p>I had no intention of letting Pickering go without reminding him
of our old acquaintance.&nbsp; He had been a very singular boy, and
I was curious to see what had become of his singularity.&nbsp; I looked
for him the next morning at two or three of the hotels, and at last
I discovered his whereabouts.&nbsp; But he was out, the waiter said;
he had gone to walk an hour before.&nbsp; I went my way, confident that
I should meet him in the evening.&nbsp; It was the rule with the Homburg
world to spend its evenings at the Kursaal, and Pickering, apparently,
had already discovered a good reason for not being an exception.&nbsp;
One of the charms of Homburg is the fact that of a hot day you may walk
about for a whole afternoon in unbroken shade.&nbsp; The umbrageous
gardens of the Kursaal mingle with the charming Hardtwald, which in
turn melts away into the wooded slopes of the Taunus Mountains.&nbsp;
To the Hardtwald I bent my steps, and strolled for an hour through mossy
glades and the still, perpendicular gloom of the fir-woods.&nbsp; Suddenly,
on the grassy margin of a by-path, I came upon a young man stretched
at his length in the sun-checkered shade, and kicking his heels towards
a patch of blue sky.&nbsp; My step was so noiseless on the turf that,
before he saw me, I had time to recognise Pickering again.&nbsp; He
looked as if he had been lounging there for some time; his hair was
tossed about as if he had been sleeping; on the grass near him, beside
his hat and stick, lay a sealed letter.&nbsp; When he perceived me he
jerked himself forward, and I stood looking at him without introducing
myself&mdash;purposely, to give him a chance to recognise me.&nbsp;
He put on his glasses, being awkwardly near-sighted, and stared up at
me with an air of general trustfulness, but without a sign of knowing
me.&nbsp; So at last I introduced myself.&nbsp; Then he jumped up and
grasped my hands, and stared and blushed and laughed, and began a dozen
random questions, ending with a demand as to how in the world I had
known him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are not changed so utterly,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and
after all, it&rsquo;s but fifteen years since you used to do my Latin
exercises for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not changed, eh?&rdquo; he answered, still smiling, and yet
speaking with a sort of ingenuous dismay.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that poor Pickering had been, in those Latin days,
a victim of juvenile irony.&nbsp; He used to bring a bottle of medicine
to school and take a dose in a glass of water before lunch; and every
day at two o&rsquo;clock, half an hour before the rest of us were liberated,
an old nurse with bushy eyebrows came and fetched him away in a carriage.&nbsp;
His extremely fair complexion, his nurse, and his bottle of medicine,
which suggested a vague analogy with the sleeping-potion in the tragedy,
caused him to be called Juliet.&nbsp; Certainly Romeo&rsquo;s sweetheart
hardly suffered more; she was not, at least, a standing joke in Verona.&nbsp;
Remembering these things, I hastened to say to Pickering that I hoped
he was still the same good fellow who used to do my Latin for me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We were capital friends, you know,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;then
and afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were very good friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
that makes it the stranger I shouldn&rsquo;t have known you.&nbsp; For
you know, as a boy, I never had many friends, nor as a man either.&nbsp;
You see,&rdquo; he added, passing his hand over his eyes, &ldquo;I am
rather dazed, rather bewildered at finding myself for the first time&mdash;alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he jerked back his shoulders nervously, and threw up his head, as
if to settle himself in an unwonted position.&nbsp; I wondered whether
the old nurse with the bushy eyebrows had remained attached to his person
up to a recent period, and discovered presently that, virtually at least,
she had.&nbsp; We had the whole summer day before us, and we sat down
on the grass together and overhauled our old memories.&nbsp; It was
as if we had stumbled upon an ancient cupboard in some dusky corner,
and rummaged out a heap of childish playthings&mdash;tin soldiers and
torn story-books, jack-knives and Chinese puzzles.&nbsp; This is what
we remembered between us.</p>
<p>He had made but a short stay at school&mdash;not because he was tormented,
for he thought it so fine to be at school at all that he held his tongue
at home about the sufferings incurred through the medicine-bottle, but
because his father thought he was learning bad manners.&nbsp; This he
imparted to me in confidence at the time, and I remember how it increased
my oppressive awe of Mr. Pickering, who had appeared to me in glimpses
as a sort of high priest of the proprieties.&nbsp; Mr. Pickering was
a widower&mdash;a fact which seemed to produce in him a sort of preternatural
concentration of parental dignity.&nbsp; He was a majestic man, with
a hooked nose, a keen dark eye, very large whiskers, and notions of
his own as to how a boy&mdash;or his boy, at any rate&mdash;should be
brought up.&nbsp; First and foremost, he was to be a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo;;
which seemed to mean, chiefly, that he was always to wear a muffler
and gloves, and be sent to bed, after a supper of bread and milk, at
eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; School-life, on experiment, seemed hostile
to these observances, and Eugene was taken home again, to be moulded
into urbanity beneath the parental eye.&nbsp; A tutor was provided for
him, and a single select companion was prescribed.&nbsp; The choice,
mysteriously, fell on me, born as I was under quite another star; my
parents were appealed to, and I was allowed for a few months to have
my lessons with Eugene.&nbsp; The tutor, I think, must have been rather
a snob, for Eugene was treated like a prince, while I got all the questions
and the raps with the ruler.&nbsp; And yet I remember never being jealous
of my happier comrade, and striking up, for the time, one of those friendships
of childhood.&nbsp; He had a watch and a pony and a great store of picture-books,
but my envy of these luxuries was tempered by a vague compassion which
left me free to be generous.&nbsp; I could go out to play alone, I could
button my jacket myself, and sit up till I was sleepy.&nbsp; Poor Pickering
could never take a step without asking leave, or spend half an hour
in the garden without a formal report of it when he came in.&nbsp; My
parents, who had no desire to see me inoculated with importunate virtues,
sent me back to school at the end of six months.&nbsp; After that I
never saw Eugene.&nbsp; His father went to live in the country, to protect
the lad&rsquo;s morals, and Eugene faded, in reminiscence, into a pale
image of the depressing effects of education.&nbsp; I think I vaguely
supposed that he would melt into thin air, and indeed began gradually
to doubt of his existence, and to regard him as one of the foolish things
one ceased to believe in as one grew older.&nbsp; It seemed natural
that I should have no more news of him.&nbsp; Our present meeting was
my first assurance that he had really survived all that muffling and
coddling.</p>
<p>I observed him now with a good deal of interest, for he was a rare
phenomenon&mdash;the fruit of a system persistently and uninterruptedly
applied.&nbsp; He struck me, in a fashion, as certain young monks I
had seen in Italy; he had the same candid, unsophisticated cloister
face.&nbsp; His education had been really almost monastic.&nbsp; It
had found him evidently a very compliant, yielding subject; his gentle
affectionate spirit was not one of those that need to be broken.&nbsp;
It had bequeathed him, now that he stood on the threshold of the great
world, an extraordinary freshness of impression and alertness of desire,
and I confess that, as I looked at him and met his transparent blue
eye, I trembled for the unwarned innocence of such a soul.&nbsp; I became
aware, gradually, that the world had already wrought a certain work
upon him and roused him to a restless, troubled self-consciousness.&nbsp;
Everything about him pointed to an experience from which he had been
debarred; his whole organism trembled with a dawning sense of unsuspected
possibilities of feeling.&nbsp; This appealing tremor was indeed outwardly
visible.&nbsp; He kept shifting himself about on the grass, thrusting
his hands through his hair, wiping a light perspiration from his forehead,
breaking out to say something and rushing off to something else.&nbsp;
Our sudden meeting had greatly excited him, and I saw that I was likely
to profit by a certain overflow of sentimental fermentation.&nbsp; I
could do so with a good conscience, for all this trepidation filled
me with a great friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly fifteen years, as you say,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;since you used to call me &lsquo;butter-fingers&rsquo; for always
missing the ball.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a long time to give an account
of, and yet they have been, for me, such eventless, monotonous years,
that I could almost tell their history in ten words.&nbsp; You, I suppose,
have had all kinds of adventures and travelled over half the world.&nbsp;
I remember you had a turn for deeds of daring; I used to think you a
little Captain Cook in roundabouts, for climbing the garden fence to
get the ball when I had let it fly over.&nbsp; I climbed no fences then
or since.&nbsp; You remember my father, I suppose, and the great care
he took of me?&nbsp; I lost him some five months ago.&nbsp; From those
boyish days up to his death we were always together.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think that in fifteen years we spent half a dozen hours apart.&nbsp;
We lived in the country, winter and summer, seeing but three or four
people.&nbsp; I had a succession of tutors, and a library to browse
about in; I assure you I am a tremendous scholar.&nbsp; It was a dull
life for a growing boy, and a duller life for a young man grown, but
I never knew it.&nbsp; I was perfectly happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke
of his father at some length, and with a respect which I privately declined
to emulate.&nbsp; Mr. Pickering had been, to my sense, a frigid egotist,
unable to conceive of any larger vocation for his son than to strive
to reproduce so irreproachable a model.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know I have been
strangely brought up,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;and that the result
is something grotesque; but my education, piece by piece, in detail,
became one of my father&rsquo;s personal habits, as it were.&nbsp; He
took a fancy to it at first through his intense affection for my mother
and the sort of worship he paid her memory.&nbsp; She died at my birth,
and as I grew up, it seems that I bore an extraordinary likeness to
her.&nbsp; Besides, my father had a great many theories; he prided himself
on his conservative opinions; he thought the usual American <i>laisser-aller</i>
in education was a very vulgar practice, and that children were not
to grow up like dusty thorns by the wayside.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So
you see,&rdquo; Pickering went on, smiling and blushing, and yet with
something of the irony of vain regret, &ldquo;I am a regular garden
plant.&nbsp; I have been watched and watered and pruned, and if there
is any virtue in tending I ought to take the prize at a flower show.&nbsp;
Some three years ago my father&rsquo;s health broke down, and he was
kept very much within doors.&nbsp; So, although I was a man grown, I
lived altogether at home.&nbsp; If I was out of his sight for a quarter
of an hour he sent some one after me.&nbsp; He had severe attacks of
neuralgia, and he used to sit at his window, basking in the sun.&nbsp;
He kept an opera-glass at hand, and when I was out in the garden he
used to watch me with it.&nbsp; A few days before his death I was twenty-seven
years old, and the most innocent youth, I suppose, on the continent.&nbsp;
After he died I missed him greatly,&rdquo; Pickering continued, evidently
with no intention of making an epigram.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stayed at home,
in a sort of dull stupor.&nbsp; It seemed as if life offered itself
to me for the first time, and yet as if I didn&rsquo;t know how to take
hold of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uttered all this with a frank eagerness which increased as he
talked, and there was a singular contrast between the meagre experience
he described and a certain radiant intelligence which I seemed to perceive
in his glance and tone.&nbsp; Evidently he was a clever fellow, and
his natural faculties were excellent.&nbsp; I imagined he had read a
great deal, and recovered, in some degree, in restless intellectual
conjecture, the freedom he was condemned to ignore in practice.&nbsp;
Opportunity was now offering a meaning to the empty forms with which
his imagination was stored, but it appeared to him dimly, through the
veil of his personal diffidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not sailed round the world, as you suppose,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;but I confess I envy you the novelties you are going
to behold.&nbsp; Coming to Homburg you have plunged <i>in medias res</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at me to see if my remark contained an allusion, and hesitated
a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I know it.&nbsp; I came to Bremen in the
steamer with a very friendly German, who undertook to initiate me into
the glories and mysteries of the Fatherland.&nbsp; At this season, he
said, I must begin with Homburg.&nbsp; I landed but a fortnight ago,
and here I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he hesitated, as if he were going
to add something about the scene at the Kursaal but suddenly, nervously,
he took up the letter which was lying beside him, looked hard at the
seal with a troubled frown, and then flung it back on the grass with
a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you expect to be in Europe?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months I supposed when I came.&nbsp; But not so long&mdash;now!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he let his eyes wander to the letter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where shall you go&mdash;what shall you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere, everything, I should have said yesterday.&nbsp;
But now it is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the letter&mdash;interrogatively, and he gravely picked
it up and put it into his pocket.&nbsp; We talked for a while longer,
but I saw that he had suddenly become preoccupied; that he was apparently
weighing an impulse to break some last barrier of reserve.&nbsp; At
last he suddenly laid his hand on my arm, looked at me a moment appealingly,
and cried, &ldquo;Upon my word, I should like to tell you everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me everything, by all means,&rdquo; I answered, smiling.
&ldquo;I desire nothing better than to lie here in the shade and hear
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the question is, will you understand it?&nbsp; No
matter; you think me a queer fellow already.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy,
either, to tell you what I feel&mdash;not easy for so queer a fellow
as I to tell you in how many ways he is queer!&rdquo;&nbsp; He got up
and walked away a moment, passing his hand over his eyes, then came
back rapidly and flung himself on the grass again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said
just now I always supposed I was happy; it&rsquo;s true; but now that
my eyes are open, I see I was only stultified.&nbsp; I was like a poodle-dog
that is led about by a blue ribbon, and scoured and combed and fed on
slops.&nbsp; It was not life; life is learning to know one&rsquo;s self,
and in that sense I have lived more in the past six weeks than in all
the years that preceded them.&nbsp; I am filled with this feverish sense
of liberation; it keeps rising to my head like the fumes of strong wine.&nbsp;
I find I am an active, sentient, intelligent creature, with desires,
with passions, with possible convictions&mdash;even with what I never
dreamed of, a possible will of my own!&nbsp; I find there is a world
to know, a life to lead, men and women to form a thousand relations
with.&nbsp; It all lies there like a great surging sea, where we must
plunge and dive and feel the breeze and breast the waves.&nbsp; I stand
shivering here on the brink, staring, longing, wondering, charmed by
the smell of the brine and yet afraid of the water.&nbsp; The world
beckons and smiles and calls, but a nameless influence from the past,
that I can neither wholly obey nor wholly resist, seems to hold me back.&nbsp;
I am full of impulses, but, somehow, I am not full of strength.&nbsp;
Life seems inspiring at certain moments, but it seems terrible and unsafe;
and I ask myself why I should wantonly measure myself with merciless
forces, when I have learned so well how to stand aside and let them
pass.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I turn my back upon it all and go home
to&mdash;what awaits me?&mdash;to that sightless, soundless country
life, and long days spent among old books?&nbsp; But if a man <i>is</i>
weak, he doesn&rsquo;t want to assent beforehand to his weakness; he
wants to taste whatever sweetness there may be in paying for the knowledge.&nbsp;
So it is that it comes back&mdash;this irresistible impulse to take
my plunge&mdash;to let myself swing, to go where liberty leads me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He paused a moment, fixing me with his excited eyes, and perhaps perceived
in my own an irrepressible smile at his perplexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Swing
ahead, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; you want to say, &lsquo;and much
good may it do you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether you are
laughing at my scruples or at what possibly strikes you as my depravity.&nbsp;
I doubt,&rdquo; he went on gravely, &ldquo;whether I have an inclination
toward wrong-doing; if I have, I am sure I shall not prosper in it.&nbsp;
I honestly believe I may safely take out a license to amuse myself.&nbsp;
But it isn&rsquo;t that I think of, any more than I dream of, playing
with suffering.&nbsp; Pleasure and pain are empty words to me; what
I long for is knowledge&mdash;some other knowledge than comes to us
in formal, colourless, impersonal precept.&nbsp; You would understand
all this better if you could breathe for an hour the musty in-door atmosphere
in which I have always lived.&nbsp; To break a window and let in light
and air&mdash;I feel as if at last I must <i>act</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act, by all means, now and always, when you have a chance,&rdquo;
I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t take things too hard, now or
ever.&nbsp; Your long confinement makes you think the world better worth
knowing than you are likely to find it.&nbsp; A man with as good a head
and heart as yours has a very ample world within himself, and I am no
believer in art for art, nor in what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;life&rsquo;
for life&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Nevertheless, take your plunge, and come
and tell me whether you have found the pearl of wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He frowned a little, as if he thought my sympathy a trifle meagre.&nbsp;
I shook him by the hand and laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The pearl of wisdom,&rdquo;
I cried, &ldquo;is love; honest love in the most convenient concentration
of experience!&nbsp; I advise you to fall in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave
me no smile in response, but drew from his pocket the letter of which
I have spoken, held it up, and shook it solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my sentence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of death, I hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a person I don&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was serious.&nbsp; I stopped smiling, and begged him to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the singular part of my story,&rdquo; he said at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will remind you of an old-fashioned romance.&nbsp; Such as
I sit here, talking in this wild way, and tossing off provocations to
destiny, my destiny is settled and sealed.&nbsp; I am engaged, I am
given in marriage.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bequest of the past&mdash;the
past I had no hand in!&nbsp; The marriage was arranged by my father,
years ago, when I was a boy.&nbsp; The young girl&rsquo;s father was
his particular friend; he was also a widower, and was bringing up his
daughter, on his side, in the same severe seclusion in which I was spending
my days.&nbsp; To this day I am unacquainted with the origin of the
bond of union between our respective progenitors.&nbsp; Mr. Vernor was
largely engaged in business, and I imagine that once upon a time he
found himself in a financial strait and was helped through it by my
father&rsquo;s coming forward with a heavy loan, on which, in his situation,
he could offer no security but his word.&nbsp; Of this my father was
quite capable.&nbsp; He was a man of dogmas, and he was sure to have
a rule of life&mdash;as clear as if it had been written out in his beautiful
copper-plate hand&mdash;adapted to the conduct of a gentleman toward
a friend in pecuniary embarrassment.&nbsp; What is more, he was sure
to adhere to it.&nbsp; Mr. Vernor, I believe, got on his feet, paid
his debt, and vowed my father an eternal gratitude.&nbsp; His little
daughter was the apple of his eye, and he pledged himself to bring her
up to be the wife of his benefactor&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; So our fate was
fixed, parentally, and we have been educated for each other.&nbsp; I
have not seen my betrothed since she was a very plain-faced little girl
in a sticky pinafore, hugging a one-armed doll&mdash;of the male sex,
I believe&mdash;as big as herself.&nbsp; Mr. Vernor is in what is called
the Eastern trade, and has been living these many years at Smyrna.&nbsp;
Isabel has grown up there in a white-walled garden, in an orange grove,
between her father and her governess.&nbsp; She is a good deal my junior;
six months ago she was seventeen; when she is eighteen we are to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He related all this calmly enough, without the accent of complaint,
drily rather and doggedly, as if he were weary of thinking of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a romance, indeed, for these dull days,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and I heartily congratulate you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not every young
man who finds, on reaching the marrying age, a wife kept in a box of
rose-leaves for him.&nbsp; A thousand to one Miss Vernor is charming;
I wonder you don&rsquo;t post off to Smyrna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are joking,&rdquo; he answered, with a wounded air, &ldquo;and
I am terribly serious.&nbsp; Let me tell you the rest.&nbsp; I never
suspected this superior conspiracy till something less than a year ago.&nbsp;
My father, wishing to provide against his death, informed me of it very
solemnly.&nbsp; I was neither elated nor depressed; I received it, as
I remember, with a sort of emotion which varied only in degree from
that with which I could have hailed the announcement that he had ordered
me a set of new shirts.&nbsp; I supposed that was the way that all marriages
were made; I had heard of their being made in heaven, and what was my
father but a divinity?&nbsp; Novels and poems, indeed, talked about
falling in love; but novels and poems were one thing and life was another.&nbsp;
A short time afterwards he introduced me to a photograph of my predestined,
who has a pretty, but an extremely inanimate, face.&nbsp; After this
his health failed rapidly.&nbsp; One night I was sitting, as I habitually
sat for hours, in his dimly-lighted room, near his bed, to which he
had been confined for a week.&nbsp; He had not spoken for some time,
and I supposed he was asleep; but happening to look at him I saw his
eyes wide open, and fixed on me strangely.&nbsp; He was smiling benignantly,
intensely, and in a moment he beckoned to me.&nbsp; Then, on my going
to him&mdash;&lsquo;I feel that I shall not last long,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;but I am willing to die when I think how comfortably I have arranged
your future.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was talking of death, and anything but
grief at that moment was doubtless impious and monstrous; but there
came into my heart for the first time a throbbing sense of being over-governed.&nbsp;
I said nothing, and he thought my silence was all sorrow.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall not live to see you married,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;but since
the foundation is laid, that little signifies; it would be a selfish
pleasure, and I have never thought of myself but in you.&nbsp; To foresee
your future, in its main outline, to know to a certainty that you will
be safely domiciled here, with a wife approved by my judgment, cultivating
the moral fruit of which I have sown the seed&mdash;this will content
me.&nbsp; But, my son, I wish to clear this bright vision from the shadow
of a doubt.&nbsp; I believe in your docility; I believe I may trust
the salutary force of your respect for my memory.&nbsp; But I must remember
that when I am removed you will stand here alone, face to face with
a hundred nameless temptations to perversity.&nbsp; The fumes of unrighteous
pride may rise into your brain and tempt you, in the interest of a vulgar
theory which it will call your independence, to shatter the edifice
I have so laboriously constructed.&nbsp; So I must ask you for a promise&mdash;the
solemn promise you owe my condition.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he grasped my
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will follow the path I have marked; you will
be faithful to the young girl whom an influence as devoted as that which
has governed your own young life has moulded into everything amiable;
you will marry Isabel Vernor.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was pretty &lsquo;steep,&rsquo;
as we used to say at school.&nbsp; I was frightened; I drew away my
hand and asked to be trusted without any such terrible vow.&nbsp; My
reluctance startled my father into a suspicion that the vulgar theory
of independence had already been whispering to me.&nbsp; He sat up in
his bed and looked at me with eyes which seemed to foresee a lifetime
of odious ingratitude.&nbsp; I felt the reproach; I feel it now.&nbsp;
I promised!&nbsp; And even now I don&rsquo;t regret my promise nor complain
of my father&rsquo;s tenacity.&nbsp; I feel, somehow, as if the seeds
of ultimate repose had been sown in those unsuspecting years&mdash;as
if after many days I might gather the mellow fruit.&nbsp; But after
many days!&nbsp; I will keep my promise, I will obey; but I want to
<i>live</i> first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you are living now.&nbsp; All this passionate
consciousness of your situation is a very ardent life.&nbsp; I wish
I could say as much for my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to forget my situation.&nbsp; I want to spend three
months without thinking of the past or the future, grasping whatever
the present offers me.&nbsp; Yesterday I thought I was in a fair way
to sail with the tide.&nbsp; But this morning comes this memento!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he held up his letter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter from Smyrna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have not yet broken the seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nor do I mean to, for the present.&nbsp; It contains bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call bad news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News that I am expected in Smyrna in three weeks.&nbsp; News
that Mr. Vernor disapproves of my roving about the world.&nbsp; News
that his daughter is standing expectant at the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this pure conjecture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjecture, possibly, but safe conjecture.&nbsp; As soon as
I looked at the letter something smote me at the heart.&nbsp; Look at
the device on the seal, and I am sure you will find it&rsquo;s <i>Tarry
not</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he flung the letter on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, you had better open it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to open it and read my summons, do you know what
I should do?&nbsp; I should march home and ask the Oberkellner how one
gets to Smyrna, pack my trunk, take my ticket, and not stop till I arrived.&nbsp;
I know I should; it would be the fascination of habit.&nbsp; The only
way, therefore, to wander to my rope&rsquo;s end is to leave the letter
unread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your place,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;curiosity would make
me open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no curiosity!&nbsp; For a
long time now the idea of my marriage has ceased to be a novelty, and
I have contemplated it mentally in every possible light.&nbsp; I fear
nothing from that side, but I do fear something from conscience.&nbsp;
I want my hands tied.&nbsp; Will you do me a favour?&nbsp; Pick up the
letter, put it into your pocket, and keep it till I ask you for it.&nbsp;
When I do, you may know that I am at my rope&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the letter, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how long is your rope
to be?&nbsp; The Homburg season doesn&rsquo;t last for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it last a month?&nbsp; Let that be my season!&nbsp; A
month hence you will give it back to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow if you say so.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let it rest in peace!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And I consigned it to the most sacred interstice of my pocket-book.&nbsp;
To say that I was disposed to humour the poor fellow would seem to be
saying that I thought his request fantastic.&nbsp; It was his situation,
by no fault of his own, that was fantastic, and he was only trying to
be natural.&nbsp; He watched me put away the letter, and when it had
disappeared gave a soft sigh of relief.&nbsp; The sigh was natural,
and yet it set me thinking.&nbsp; His general recoil from an immediate
responsibility imposed by others might be wholesome enough; but if there
was an old grievance on one side, was there not possibly a new-born
delusion on the other?&nbsp; It would be unkind to withhold a reflection
that might serve as a warning; so I told him, abruptly, that I had been
an undiscovered spectator, the night before, of his exploits at roulette.</p>
<p>He blushed deeply, but he met my eyes with the same clear good-humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, you saw that wonderful lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful she was indeed.&nbsp; I saw her afterwards, too,
sitting on the terrace in the starlight.&nbsp; I imagine she was not
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I was with her&mdash;for nearly an hour.&nbsp;
Then I walked home with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; And did you go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she said it was too late to ask me; though she remarked
that in a general way she did not stand upon ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did herself injustice.&nbsp; When it came to losing your
money for you, she made you insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you noticed that too?&rdquo; cried Pickering, still quite
unconfused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt as if the whole table were staring at
me; but her manner was so gracious and reassuring that I supposed she
was doing nothing unusual.&nbsp; She confessed, however, afterwards,
that she is very eccentric.&nbsp; The world began to call her so, she
said, before she ever dreamed of it, and at last finding that she had
the reputation, in spite of herself, she resolved to enjoy its privileges.&nbsp;
Now, she does what she chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, she is a lady with no reputation to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pickering seemed puzzled; he smiled a little. &ldquo;Is not that
what you say of bad women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of some&mdash;of those who are found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, still smiling, &ldquo;I have not yet
found out Madame Blumenthal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s her name, I suppose she&rsquo;s German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but she speaks English so well that you wouldn&rsquo;t
know it.&nbsp; She is very clever.&nbsp; Her husband is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed involuntarily at the conjunction of these facts, and Pickering&rsquo;s
clear glance seemed to question my mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have been
so bluntly frank with me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I too must be frank.&nbsp;
Tell me, if you can, whether this clever Madame Blumenthal, whose husband
is dead, has given a point to your desire for a suspension of communication
with Smyrna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to ponder my question, unshrinkingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
not,&rdquo; he said, at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have had the desire for
three months; I have known Madame Blumenthal for less than twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true.&nbsp; But when you found this letter of yours on
your place at breakfast, did you seem for a moment to see Madame Blumenthal
sitting opposite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opposite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opposite, my dear fellow, or anywhere in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
In a word, does she interest you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much!&rdquo; he cried, joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; I answered, jumping up with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
now, if we are to see the world in a month, there is no time to lose.&nbsp;
Let us begin with the Hardtwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pickering rose, and we strolled away into the forest, talking of
lighter things.&nbsp; At last we reached the edge of the wood, sat down
on a fallen log, and looked out across an interval of meadow at the
long wooded waves of the Taunus.&nbsp; What my friend was thinking of
I can&rsquo;t say; I was meditating on his queer biography, and letting
my wonderment wander away to Smyrna.&nbsp; Suddenly I remembered that
he possessed a portrait of the young girl who was waiting for him there
in a white-walled garden.&nbsp; I asked him if he had it with him.&nbsp;
He said nothing, but gravely took out his pocket-book and drew forth
a small photograph.&nbsp; It represented, as the poet says, a simple
maiden in her flower&mdash;a slight young girl, with a certain childish
roundness of contour.&nbsp; There was no ease in her posture; she was
standing, stiffly and shyly, for her likeness; she wore a short-waisted
white dress; her arms hung at her sides and her hands were clasped in
front; her head was bent downward a little, and her dark eyes fixed.&nbsp;
But her awkwardness was as pretty as that of some angular seraph in
a medi&aelig;val carving, and in her timid gaze there seemed to lurk
the questioning gleam of childhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is this for?&rdquo;
her charming eyes appeared to ask; &ldquo;why have I been dressed up
for this ceremony in a white frock and amber beads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious powers!&rdquo; I said to myself; &ldquo;what an enchanting
thing is innocence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That portrait was taken a year and a half ago,&rdquo; said
Pickering, as if with an effort to be perfectly just.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
this time, I suppose, she looks a little wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I hope,&rdquo; I said, as I gave it back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is very sweet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor girl, she is very sweet&mdash;no doubt!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he put the thing away without looking at it.</p>
<p>We were silent for some moments.&nbsp; At last, abruptly&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should take some satisfaction in
seeing you immediately leave Homburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day&mdash;as soon as you can get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me, surprised, and little by little he blushed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is something I have not told you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;something
that your saying that Madame Blumenthal has no reputation to lose has
made me half afraid to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can guess it.&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal has asked
you to come and play her game for her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; cried Pickering, with a smile of triumph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She says that she means to play no more for the present.&nbsp;
She has asked me to come and take tea with her this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; I said, very gravely, &ldquo;of course you
can&rsquo;t leave Homburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered nothing, but looked askance at me, as if he were expecting
me to laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Urge it strongly,&rdquo; he said in a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Say it&rsquo;s my duty&mdash;that I <i>must</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite understand him, but, feathering the shaft with
a harmless expletive, I told him that unless he followed my advice I
would never speak to him again.</p>
<p>He got up, stood before me, and struck the ground with his stick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I wanted an occasion to break a
rule&mdash;to leap a barrier.&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp; I stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made him a mock bow for his energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very
fine,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but now, to put you in a proper mood for
Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s tea, we will go and listen to the band play
Schubert under the lindens.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we walked back through
the woods.</p>
<p>I went to see Pickering the next day, at his inn, and on knocking,
as directed, at his door, was surprised to hear the sound of a loud
voice within.&nbsp; My knock remained unnoticed, so I presently introduced
myself.&nbsp; I found no company, but I discovered my friend walking
up and down the room and apparently declaiming to himself from a little
volume bound in white vellum.&nbsp; He greeted me heartily, threw his
book on the table, and said that he was taking a German lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is your teacher?&rdquo; I asked, glancing at the book.</p>
<p>He rather avoided meeting my eye, as he answered, after an instant&rsquo;s
delay, &ldquo;Madame Blumenthal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Has she written a grammar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a grammar; it&rsquo;s a tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he handed me the book.</p>
<p>I opened it, and beheld, in delicate type, with a very large margin,
an <i>Historisches Trauerspiel</i> in five acts, entitled &ldquo;Cleopatra.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There were a great many marginal corrections and annotations, apparently
from the author&rsquo;s hand; the speeches were very long, and there
was an inordinate number of soliloquies by the heroine.&nbsp; One of
them, I remember, towards the end of the play, began in this fashion&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, after all, is life but sensation, and sensation but
deception?&mdash;reality that pales before the light of one&rsquo;s
dreams as Octavia&rsquo;s dull beauty fades beside mine?&nbsp; But let
me believe in some intenser bliss, and seek it in the arms of death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems decidedly passionate,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has
the tragedy ever been acted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in public; but Madame Blumenthal tells me that she had
it played at her own house in Berlin, and that she herself undertook
the part of the heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pickering&rsquo;s unworldly life had not been of a sort to sharpen
his perception of the ridiculous, but it seemed to me an unmistakable
sign of his being under the charm, that this information was very soberly
offered.&nbsp; He was preoccupied, he was irresponsive to my experimental
observations on vulgar topics&mdash;the hot weather, the inn, the advent
of Adelina Patti.&nbsp; At last, uttering his thoughts, he announced
that Madame Blumenthal had proved to be an extraordinarily interesting
woman.&nbsp; He seemed to have quite forgotten our long talk in the
Hartwaldt, and betrayed no sense of this being a confession that he
had taken his plunge and was floating with the current.&nbsp; He only
remembered that I had spoken slightingly of the lady, and he now hinted
that it behoved me to amend my opinion.&nbsp; I had received the day
before so strong an impression of a sort of spiritual fastidiousness
in my friend&rsquo;s nature, that on hearing now the striking of a new
hour, as it were, in his consciousness, and observing how the echoes
of the past were immediately quenched in its music, I said to myself
that it had certainly taken a delicate hand to wind up that fine machine.&nbsp;
No doubt Madame Blumenthal was a clever woman.&nbsp; It is a good German
custom at Homburg to spend the hour preceding dinner in listening to
the orchestra in the Kurgarten; Mozart and Beethoven, for organisms
in which the interfusion of soul and sense is peculiarly mysterious,
are a vigorous stimulus to the appetite.&nbsp; Pickering and I conformed,
as we had done the day before, to the fashion, and when we were seated
under the trees, he began to expatiate on his friend&rsquo;s merits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether she is eccentric or not,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;to me every one seems eccentric, and it&rsquo;s not
for me, yet a while, to measure people by my narrow precedents.&nbsp;
I never saw a gaming table in my life before, and supposed that a gambler
was of necessity some dusky villain with an evil eye.&nbsp; In Germany,
says Madame Blumenthal, people play at roulette as they play at billiards,
and her own venerable mother originally taught her the rules of the
game.&nbsp; It is a recognised source of subsistence for decent people
with small means.&nbsp; But I confess Madame Blumenthal might do worse
things than play at roulette, and yet make them harmonious and beautiful.&nbsp;
I have never been in the habit of thinking positive beauty the most
excellent thing in a woman.&nbsp; I have always said to myself that
if my heart were ever to be captured it would be by a sort of general
grace&mdash;a sweetness of motion and tone&mdash;on which one could
count for soothing impressions, as one counts on a musical instrument
that is perfectly in tune.&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal has it&mdash;this
grace that soothes and satisfies; and it seems the more perfect that
it keeps order and harmony in a character really passionately ardent
and active.&nbsp; With her eager nature and her innumerable accomplishments
nothing would be easier than that she should seem restless and aggressive.&nbsp;
You will know her, and I leave you to judge whether she does seem so!&nbsp;
She has every gift, and culture has done everything for each.&nbsp;
What goes on in her mind I of course can&rsquo;t say; what reaches the
observer&mdash;the admirer&mdash;is simply a sort of fragrant emanation
of intelligence and sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Blumenthal,&rdquo; I said, smiling, &ldquo;might be
the loveliest woman in the world, and you the object of her choicest
favours, and yet what I should most envy you would be, not your peerless
friend, but your beautiful imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a polite way of calling me a fool,&rdquo; said
Pickering.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a sceptic, a cynic, a satirist!&nbsp;
I hope I shall be a long time coming to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will make the journey fast if you travel by express trains.&nbsp;
But pray tell me, have you ventured to intimate to Madame Blumenthal
your high opinion of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I may have said.&nbsp; She listens
even better than she talks, and I think it possible I may have made
her listen to a great deal of nonsense.&nbsp; For after the first few
words I exchanged with her I was conscious of an extraordinary evaporation
of all my old diffidence.&nbsp; I have, in truth, I suppose,&rdquo;
he added in a moment, &ldquo;owing to my peculiar circumstances, a great
accumulated fund of unuttered things of all sorts to get rid of.&nbsp;
Last evening, sitting there before that charming woman, they came swarming
to my lips.&nbsp; Very likely I poured them all out.&nbsp; I have a
sense of having enshrouded myself in a sort of mist of talk, and of
seeing her lovely eyes shining through it opposite to me, like fog-lamps
at sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here, if I remember rightly, Pickering broke
off into an ardent parenthesis, and declared that Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s
eyes had something in them that he had never seen in any others.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was a jumble of crudities and inanities,&rdquo; he went on;
&ldquo;they must have seemed to her great rubbish; but I felt the wiser
and the stronger, somehow, for having fired off all my guns&mdash;they
could hurt nobody now if they hit&mdash;and I imagine I might have gone
far without finding another woman in whom such an exhibition would have
provoked so little of mere cold amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Blumenthal, on the contrary,&rdquo; I surmised, &ldquo;entered
into your situation with warmth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so&mdash;the greatest!&nbsp; She has felt and suffered,
and now she understands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told you, I imagine, that she understood you as if she
had made you, and she offered to be your guide, philosopher, and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She spoke to me,&rdquo; Pickering answered, after a pause,
&ldquo;as I had never been spoken to before, and she offered me, formally,
all the offices of a woman&rsquo;s friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you as formally accepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you the scene sounds absurd, I suppose, but allow me to
say I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pickering spoke with an air of
genial defiance which was the most inoffensive thing in the world.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was very much moved; I was, in fact, very much excited.&nbsp;
I tried to say something, but I couldn&rsquo;t; I had had plenty to
say before, but now I stammered and bungled, and at last I bolted out
of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile she had dropped her tragedy into your pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I had seen it on the table before she came
in.&nbsp; Afterwards she kindly offered to read German aloud with me,
for the accent, two or three times a week.&nbsp; &lsquo;What shall we
begin with?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;With this!&rsquo; I said,
and held up the book.&nbsp; And she let me take it to look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was neither a cynic nor a satirist, but even if I had been, I might
have been disarmed by Pickering&rsquo;s assurance, before we parted,
that Madame Blumenthal wished to know me and expected him to introduce
me.&nbsp; Among the foolish things which, according to his own account,
he had uttered, were some generous words in my praise, to which she
had civilly replied.&nbsp; I confess I was curious to see her, but I
begged that the introduction should not be immediate, for I wished to
let Pickering work out his destiny alone.&nbsp; For some days I saw
little of him, though we met at the Kursaal and strolled occasionally
in the park.&nbsp; I watched, in spite of my desire to let him alone,
for the signs and portents of the world&rsquo;s action upon him&mdash;of
that portion of the world, in especial, of which Madame Blumenthal had
constituted herself the agent.&nbsp; He seemed very happy, and gave
me in a dozen ways an impression of increased self-confidence and maturity.&nbsp;
His mind was admirably active, and always, after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
talk with him, I asked myself what experience could really do, that
innocence had not done, to make it bright and fine.&nbsp; I was struck
with his deep enjoyment of the whole spectacle of foreign life&mdash;its
novelty, its picturesqueness, its light and shade&mdash;and with the
infinite freedom with which he felt he could go and come and rove and
linger and observe it all.&nbsp; It was an expansion, an awakening,
a coming to moral manhood.&nbsp; Each time I met him he spoke a little
less of Madame Blumenthal; but he let me know generally that he saw
her often, and continued to admire her.&nbsp; I was forced to admit
to myself, in spite of preconceptions, that if she were really the ruling
star of this happy season, she must be a very superior woman.&nbsp;
Pickering had the air of an ingenuous young philosopher sitting at the
feet of an austere muse, and not of a sentimental spendthrift dangling
about some supreme incarnation of levity.</p>

<p>Madame Blumenthal seemed, for the time, to have abjured the Kursaal,
and I never caught a glimpse of her.&nbsp; Her young friend, apparently,
was an interesting study, and the studious mind prefers seclusion.</p>
<p>She reappeared, however, at last, one evening at the opera, where
from my chair I perceived her in a box, looking extremely pretty.&nbsp;
Adelina Patti was singing, and after the rising of the curtain I was
occupied with the stage; but on looking round when it fell for the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>,
I saw that the authoress of &ldquo;Cleopatra&rdquo; had been joined
by her young admirer.&nbsp; He was sitting a little behind her, leaning
forward, looking over her shoulder and listening, while she, slowly
moving her fan to and fro and letting her eye wander over the house,
was apparently talking of this person and that.&nbsp; No doubt she was
saying sharp things; but Pickering was not laughing; his eyes were following
her covert indications; his mouth was half open, as it always was when
he was interested; he looked intensely serious.&nbsp; I was glad that,
having her back to him, she was unable to see how he looked.&nbsp; It
seemed the proper moment to present myself and make her my bow; but
just as I was about to leave my place a gentleman, whom in a moment
I perceived to be an old acquaintance, came to occupy the next chair.&nbsp;
Recognition and mutual greetings followed, and I was forced to postpone
my visit to Madame Blumenthal.&nbsp; I was not sorry, for it very soon
occurred to me that Niedermeyer would be just the man to give me a fair
prose version of Pickering&rsquo;s lyric tributes to his friend.&nbsp;
He was an Austrian by birth, and had formerly lived about Europe a great
deal in a series of small diplomatic posts.&nbsp; England especially
he had often visited, and he spoke the language almost without accent.&nbsp;
I had once spent three rainy days with him in the house of an English
friend in the country.&nbsp; He was a sharp observer, and a good deal
of a gossip; he knew a little something about every one, and about some
people everything.&nbsp; His knowledge on social matters generally had
the quality of all German science; it was copious, minute, exhaustive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell me,&rdquo; I said, as we stood looking round the house,
&ldquo;who and what is the lady in white, with the young man sitting
behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he answered, dropping his glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame
Blumenthal!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; It would take long to say.&nbsp; Be introduced;
it&rsquo;s easily done; you will find her charming.&nbsp; Then, after
a week, you will tell me what she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should not.&nbsp; My friend there has known her
a week, and I don&rsquo;t think he is yet able to give a coherent account
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his glass again, and after looking a while, &ldquo;I am
afraid your friend is a little&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a little
&lsquo;soft.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor fellow! he&rsquo;s not the first.&nbsp;
I have never known this lady that she has not had some eligible youth
hovering about in some such attitude as that, undergoing the softening
process.&nbsp; She looks wonderfully well, from here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
extraordinary how those women last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean, I take it, when you talk about &lsquo;those
women,&rsquo; that Madame Blumenthal is not embalmed, for duration,
in a certain infusion of respectability?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no.&nbsp; The atmosphere that surrounds her is entirely
of her own making.&nbsp; There is no reason in her antecedents that
people should drop their voice when they speak of her.&nbsp; But some
women are never at their ease till they have given some damnable twist
or other to their position before the world.&nbsp; The attitude of upright
virtue is unbecoming, like sitting too straight in a fauteuil.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t ask me for opinions, however; content yourself with a few
facts and with an anecdote.&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal is Prussian, and
very well born.&nbsp; I remember her mother, an old Westphalian Gr&auml;fin,
with principles marshalled out like Frederick the Great&rsquo;s grenadiers.&nbsp;
She was poor, however, and her principles were an insufficient dowry
for Anastasia, who was married very young to a vicious Jew, twice her
own age.&nbsp; He was supposed to have money, but I am afraid he had
less than was nominated in the bond, or else that his pretty young wife
spent it very fast.&nbsp; She has been a widow these six or eight years,
and has lived, I imagine, in rather a hand-to-mouth fashion.&nbsp; I
suppose she is some six or eight and thirty years of age.&nbsp; In winter
one hears of her in Berlin, giving little suppers to the artistic rabble
there; in summer one often sees her across the green table at Ems and
Wiesbaden.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very clever, and her cleverness has spoiled
her.&nbsp; A year after her marriage she published a novel, with her
views on matrimony, in the George Sand manner&mdash;beating the drum
to Madame Sand&rsquo;s trumpet.&nbsp; No doubt she was very unhappy;
Blumenthal was an old beast.&nbsp; Since then she has published a lot
of literature&mdash;novels and poems and pamphlets on every conceivable
theme, from the conversion of Lola Montez to the Hegelian philosophy.&nbsp;
Her talk is much better than her writing.&nbsp; Her <i>conjugophobia</i>&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t call it by any other name&mdash;made people think lightly
of her at a time when her rebellion against marriage was probably only
theoretic.&nbsp; She had a taste for spinning fine phrases, she drove
her shuttle, and when she came to the end of her yarn she found that
society had turned its back.&nbsp; She tossed her head, declared that
at last she could breathe the sacred air of freedom, and formally announced
that she had embraced an &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; life.&nbsp; This
meant unlimited <i>camaraderie</i> with scribblers and daubers, Hegelian
philosophers and Hungarian pianists.&nbsp; But she has been admired
also by a great many really clever men; there was a time, in fact, when
she turned a head as well set on its shoulders as this one!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Niedermeyer tapped his forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has a great charm,
and, literally, I know no harm of her.&nbsp; Yet for all that, I am
not going to speak to her; I am not going near her box.&nbsp; I am going
to leave her to say, if she does me the honour to observe the omission,
that I too have gone over to the Philistines.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that;
it is that there is something sinister about the woman.&nbsp; I am too
old for it to frighten me, but I am good-natured enough for it to pain
me.&nbsp; Her quarrel with society has brought her no happiness, and
her outward charm is only the mask of a dangerous discontent.&nbsp;
Her imagination is lodged where her heart should be!&nbsp; So long as
you amuse it, well and good; she&rsquo;s radiant.&nbsp; But the moment
you let it flag, she is capable of dropping you without a pang.&nbsp;
If you land on your feet you are so much the wiser, simply; but there
have been two or three, I believe, who have almost broken their necks
in the fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are reversing your promise,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
giving me an opinion, but not an anecdote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my anecdote.&nbsp; A year ago a friend of mine made
her acquaintance in Berlin, and though he was no longer a young man,
and had never been what is called a susceptible one, he took a great
fancy to Madame Blumenthal.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a major in the Prussian
artillery&mdash;grizzled, grave, a trifle severe, a man every way firm
in the faith of his fathers.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a proof of Anastasia&rsquo;s
charm that such a man should have got into the habit of going to see
her every day of his life.&nbsp; But the major was in love, or next
door to it!&nbsp; Every day that he called he found her scribbling away
at a little ormolu table on a lot of half-sheets of note-paper.&nbsp;
She used to bid him sit down and hold his tongue for a quarter of an
hour, till she had finished her chapter; she was writing a novel, and
it was promised to a publisher.&nbsp; Clorinda, she confided to him,
was the name of the injured heroine.&nbsp; The major, I imagine, had
never read a work of fiction in his life, but he knew by hearsay that
Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s literature, when put forth in pink covers,
was subversive of several respectable institutions.&nbsp; Besides, he
didn&rsquo;t believe in women knowing how to write at all, and it irritated
him to see this inky goddess correcting proof-sheets under his nose&mdash;irritated
him the more that, as I say, he was in love with her and that he ventured
to believe she had a kindness for his years and his honours.&nbsp; And
yet she was not such a woman as he could easily ask to marry him.&nbsp;
The result of all this was that he fell into the way of railing at her
intellectual pursuits and saying he should like to run his sword through
her pile of papers.&nbsp; A woman was clever enough when she could guess
her husband&rsquo;s wishes, and learned enough when she could read him
the newspapers.&nbsp; At last, one day, Madame Blumenthal flung down
her pen and announced in triumph that she had finished her novel.&nbsp;
Clorinda had expired in the arms of&mdash;some one else than her husband.&nbsp;
The major, by way of congratulating her, declared that her novel was
immoral rubbish, and that her love of vicious paradoxes was only a peculiarly
depraved form of coquetry.&nbsp; He added, however, that he loved her
in spite of her follies, and that if she would formally abjure them
he would as formally offer her his hand.&nbsp; They say that women like
to be snubbed by military men.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure;
I don&rsquo;t know how much pleasure, on this occasion, was mingled
with Anastasia&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; But her wrath was very quiet, and
the major assured me it made her look uncommonly pretty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have told you before,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;that I write from an inner
need.&nbsp; I write to unburden my heart, to satisfy my conscience.&nbsp;
You call my poor efforts coquetry, vanity, the desire to produce a sensation.&nbsp;
I can prove to you that it is the quiet labour itself I care for, and
not the world&rsquo;s more or less flattering attention to it!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And seizing the history of Clorinda she thrust it into the fire.&nbsp;
The major stands staring, and the first thing he knows she is sweeping
him a great curtsey and bidding him farewell for ever.&nbsp; Left alone
and recovering his wits, he fishes out Clorinda from the embers, and
then proceeds to thump vigorously at the lady&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; But
it never opened, and from that day to the day three months ago when
he told me the tale, he had not beheld her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s a striking story,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the question is, what does it prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several things.&nbsp; First (what I was careful not to tell
my friend), that Madame Blumenthal cared for him a trifle more than
he supposed; second, that he cares for her more than ever; third, that
the performance was a master-stroke, and that her allowing him to force
an interview upon her again is only a question of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is another anecdote.&nbsp; The other day, Unter den Linden,
I saw on a bookseller&rsquo;s counter a little pink-covered romance&mdash;&lsquo;Sophronia,&rsquo;
by Madame Blumenthal.&nbsp; Glancing through it, I observed an extraordinary
abuse of asterisks; every two or three pages the narrative was adorned
with a portentous blank, crossed with a row of stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but poor Clorinda?&rdquo; I objected, as Niedermeyer
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophronia, my dear fellow, is simply Clorinda renamed by the
baptism of fire.&nbsp; The fair author came back, of course, and found
Clorinda tumbled upon the floor, a good deal scorched, but, on the whole,
more frightened than hurt.&nbsp; She picks her up, brushes her off,
and sends her to the printer.&nbsp; Wherever the flames had burnt a
hole she swings a constellation!&nbsp; But if the major is prepared
to drop a penitent tear over the ashes of Clorinda, I shall not whisper
to him that the urn is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Adelina Patti&rsquo;s singing, for the next half-hour, but half
availed to divert me from my quickened curiosity to behold Madame Blumenthal
face to face.&nbsp; As soon as the curtain had fallen again I repaired
to her box and was ushered in by Pickering with zealous hospitality.&nbsp;
His glowing smile seemed to say to me, &ldquo;Ay, look for yourself,
and adore!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing could have been more gracious than the
lady&rsquo;s greeting, and I found, somewhat to my surprise, that her
prettiness lost nothing on a nearer view.&nbsp; Her eyes indeed were
the finest I have ever seen&mdash;the softest, the deepest, the most
intensely responsive.&nbsp; In spite of something faded and jaded in
her physiognomy, her movements, her smile, and the tone of her voice,
especially when she laughed, had an almost girlish frankness and spontaneity.&nbsp;
She looked at you very hard with her radiant gray eyes, and she indulged
while she talked in a superabundance of restless, rather affected little
gestures, as if to make you take her meaning in a certain very particular
and superfine sense.&nbsp; I wondered whether after a while this might
not fatigue one&rsquo;s attention; then meeting her charming eyes, I
said, Not for a long time.&nbsp; She was very clever, and, as Pickering
had said, she spoke English admirably.&nbsp; I told her, as I took my
seat beside her, of the fine things I had heard about her from my friend,
and she listened, letting me go on some time, and exaggerate a little,
with her fine eyes fixed full upon me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she
suddenly said, turning short round upon Pickering, who stood behind
us, and looking at him in the same way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that the way
you talk about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blushed to his eyes, and I repented.&nbsp; She suddenly began
to laugh; it was then I observed how sweet her voice was in laughter.&nbsp;
We talked after this of various matters, and in a little while I complimented
her on her excellent English, and asked if she had learnt it in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never
been there and wish never to go.&nbsp; I should never get on with the&mdash;&rdquo;
I wondered what she was going to say; the fogs, the smoke, or whist
with sixpenny stakes?&mdash;&ldquo;I should never get on,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;with the aristocracy!&nbsp; I am a fierce democrat&mdash;I
am not ashamed of it.&nbsp; I hold opinions which would make my ancestors
turn in their graves.&nbsp; I was born in the lap of feudalism.&nbsp;
I am a daughter of the crusaders.&nbsp; But I am a revolutionist!&nbsp;
I have a passion for freedom&mdash;my idea of happiness is to die on
a great barricade!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s to your great country I should like
to go.&nbsp; I should like to see the wonderful spectacle of a great
people free to do everything it chooses, and yet never doing anything
wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, modestly, that, after all, both our freedom and our good
conduct had their limits, and she turned quickly about and shook her
fan with a dramatic gesture at Pickering.&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter, no
matter!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I should like to see the country which
produced that wonderful young man.&nbsp; I think of it as a sort of
Arcadia&mdash;a land of the golden age.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s so delightfully
innocent!&nbsp; In this stupid old Germany, if a young man is innocent
he&rsquo;s a fool; he has no brains; he&rsquo;s not a bit interesting.&nbsp;
But Mr. Pickering says the freshest things, and after I have laughed
five minutes at their freshness it suddenly occurs to me that they are
very wise, and I think them over for a week.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;True!&rdquo;
she went on, nodding at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call them inspired solecisms,
and I treasure them up.&nbsp; Remember that when I next laugh at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing at Pickering, I was prompted to believe that he was in a
state of beatific exaltation which weighed Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s
smiles and frowns in an equal balance.&nbsp; They were equally hers;
they were links alike in the golden chain.&nbsp; He looked at me with
eyes that seemed to say, &ldquo;Did you ever hear such wit?&nbsp; Did
you ever see such grace?&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed to me that he was but
vaguely conscious of the meaning of her words; her gestures, her voice
and glance, made an absorbing harmony.&nbsp; There is something painful
in the spectacle of absolute enthralment, even to an excellent cause.&nbsp;
I gave no response to Pickering&rsquo;s challenge, but made some remark
upon the charm of Adelina Patti&rsquo;s singing.&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal,
as became a &ldquo;revolutionist,&rdquo; was obliged to confess that
she could see no charm in it; it was meagre, it was trivial, it lacked
soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must know that in music, too,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I think for myself!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she began with a great many
flourishes of her fan to explain what it was she thought.&nbsp; Remarkable
things, doubtless; but I cannot answer for it, for in the midst of the
explanation the curtain rose again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be
a great artist without a great passion!&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal
was affirming.&nbsp; Before I had time to assent Madame Patti&rsquo;s
voice rose wheeling like a skylark, and rained down its silver notes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, give me that art,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;and I will leave
you your passion!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I departed for my own place in the
orchestra.&nbsp; I wondered afterwards whether the speech had seemed
rude, and inferred that it had not on receiving a friendly nod from
the lady, in the lobby, as the theatre was emptying itself.&nbsp; She
was on Pickering&rsquo;s arm, and he was taking her to her carriage.&nbsp;
Distances are short in Homburg, but the night was rainy, and Madame
Blumenthal exhibited a very pretty satin-shod foot as a reason why,
though but a penniless widow, she should not walk home.&nbsp; Pickering
left us together a moment while he went to hail the vehicle, and my
companion seized the opportunity, as she said, to beg me to be so very
kind as to come and see her.&nbsp; It was for a particular reason!&nbsp;
It was reason enough for me, of course, I answered, that she had given
me leave.&nbsp; She looked at me a moment with that extraordinary gaze
of hers which seemed so absolutely audacious in its candour, and rejoined
that I paid more compliments than our young friend there, but that she
was sure I was not half so sincere.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s about
him I want to talk,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to ask you
many things; I want you to tell me all about him.&nbsp; He interests
me; but you see my sympathies are so intense, my imagination is so lively,
that I don&rsquo;t trust my own impressions.&nbsp; They have misled
me more than once!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she gave a little tragic shudder.</p>
<p>I promised to come and compare notes with her, and we bade her farewell
at her carriage door.&nbsp; Pickering and I remained a while, walking
up and down the long glazed gallery of the Kursaal.&nbsp; I had not
taken many steps before I became aware that I was beside a man in the
very extremity of love.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful?&rdquo;
he asked, with an implicit confidence in my sympathy which it cost me
some ingenuity to elude.&nbsp; If he were really in love, well and good!&nbsp;
For although, now that I had seen her, I stood ready to confess to large
possibilities of fascination on Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s part, and
even to certain possibilities of sincerity of which my appreciation
was vague, yet it seemed to me less ominous that he should be simply
smitten than that his admiration should pique itself on being discriminating.&nbsp;
It was on his fundamental simplicity that I counted for a happy termination
of his experiment, and the former of these alternatives seemed to me
the simpler.&nbsp; I resolved to hold my tongue and let him run his
course.&nbsp; He had a great deal to say about his happiness, about
the days passing like hours, the hours like minutes, and about Madame
Blumenthal being a &ldquo;revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She was nothing
to-night,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nothing to what she sometimes is in
the way of brilliancy&mdash;in the way of repartee.&nbsp; If you could
only hear her when she tells her adventures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventures?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has she had adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the most wonderful sort!&rdquo; cried Pickering, with rapture.
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t vegetated, like me!&nbsp; She has lived in the
tumult of life.&nbsp; When I listen to her reminiscences, it&rsquo;s
like hearing the opening tumult of one of Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies
as it loses itself in a triumphant harmony of beauty and faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could only lift my eyebrows, but I desired to know before we separated
what he had done with that troublesome conscience of his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose you know, my dear fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you are
simply in love.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they happen to call your state
of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied with a brightening eye, as if he were delighted to hear
it&mdash;&ldquo;So Madame Blumenthal told me only this morning!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And seeing, I suppose, that I was slightly puzzled, &ldquo;I went to
drive with her,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;we drove to K&ouml;nigstein,
to see the old castle.&nbsp; We scrambled up into the heart of the ruin
and sat for an hour in one of the crumbling old courts.&nbsp; Something
in the solemn stillness of the place unloosed my tongue; and while she
sat on an ivied stone, on the edge of the plunging wall, I stood there
and made a speech.&nbsp; She listened to me, looking at me, breaking
off little bits of stone and letting them drop down into the valley.&nbsp;
At last she got up and nodded at me two or three times silently, with
a smile, as if she were applauding me for a solo on the violin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are in love,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect
case!&rsquo;&nbsp; And for some time she said nothing more.&nbsp; But
before we left the place she told me that she owed me an answer to my
speech.&nbsp; She thanked me heartily, but she was afraid that if she
took me at my word she would be taking advantage of my inexperience.&nbsp;
I had known few women; I was too easily pleased; I thought her better
than she really was.&nbsp; She had great faults; I must know her longer
and find them out; I must compare her with other women&mdash;women younger,
simpler, more innocent, more ignorant; and then if I still did her the
honour to think well of her, she would listen to me again.&nbsp; I told
her that I was not afraid of preferring any woman in the world to her,
and then she repeated, &lsquo;Happy man, happy man! you are in love,
you are in love!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I called upon Madame Blumenthal a couple of days later, in some agitation
of thought.&nbsp; It has been proved that there are, here and there,
in the world, such people as sincere impostors; certain characters who
cultivate fictitious emotions in perfect good faith.&nbsp; Even if this
clever lady enjoyed poor Pickering&rsquo;s bedazzlement, it was conceivable
that, taking vanity and charity together, she should care more for his
welfare than for her own entertainment; and her offer to abide by the
result of hazardous comparison with other women was a finer stroke than
her reputation had led me to expect.&nbsp; She received me in a shabby
little sitting-room littered with uncut books and newspapers, many of
which I saw at a glance were French.&nbsp; One side of it was occupied
by an open piano, surmounted by a jar full of white roses.&nbsp; They
perfumed the air; they seemed to me to exhale the pure aroma of Pickering&rsquo;s
devotion.&nbsp; Buried in an arm-chair, the object of this devotion
was reading the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>.&nbsp; The purpose of my
visit was not to admire Madame Blumenthal on my own account, but to
ascertain how far I might safely leave her to work her will upon my
friend.&nbsp; She had impugned my sincerity the evening of the opera,
and I was careful on this occasion to abstain from compliments, and
not to place her on her guard against my penetration.&nbsp; It is needless
to narrate our interview in detail; indeed, to tell the perfect truth,
I was punished for my rash attempt to surprise her by a temporary eclipse
of my own perspicacity.&nbsp; She sat there so questioning, so perceptive,
so genial, so generous, and so pretty withal, that I was quite ready
at the end of half an hour to subscribe to the most comprehensive of
Pickering&rsquo;s rhapsodies.&nbsp; She was certainly a wonderful woman.&nbsp;
I have never liked to linger, in memory, on that half-hour.&nbsp; The
result of it was to prove that there were many more things in the composition
of a woman who, as Niedermeyer said, had lodged her imagination in the
place of her heart than were dreamt of in my philosophy.&nbsp; Yet,
as I sat there stroking my hat and balancing the account between nature
and art in my affable hostess, I felt like a very competent philosopher.&nbsp;
She had said she wished me to tell her everything about our friend,
and she questioned me as to his family, his fortune, his antecedents,
and his character.&nbsp; All this was natural in a woman who had received
a passionate declaration of love, and it was expressed with an air of
charmed solicitude, a radiant confidence that there was really no mistake
about his being a most distinguished young man, and that if I chose
to be explicit, I might deepen her conviction to disinterested ecstasy,
which might have almost provoked me to invent a good opinion, if I had
not had one ready made.&nbsp; I told her that she really knew Pickering
better than I did, and that until we met at Homburg I had not seen him
since he was a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he talks to you freely,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I
know you are his confidant.&nbsp; He has told me certainly a great many
things, but I always feel as if he were keeping something back; as if
he were holding something behind him, and showing me only one hand at
once.&nbsp; He seems often to be hovering on the edge of a secret.&nbsp;
I have had several friendships in my life&mdash;thank Heaven! but I
have had none more dear to me than this one.&nbsp; Yet in the midst
of it I have the painful sense of my friend being half afraid of me;
of his thinking me terrible, strange, perhaps a trifle out of my wits.&nbsp;
Poor me!&nbsp; If he only knew what a plain good soul I am, and how
I only want to know him and befriend him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were full of a plaintive magnanimity which made mistrust
seem cruel.&nbsp; How much better I might play providence over Pickering&rsquo;s
experiments with life if I could engage the fine instincts of this charming
woman on the providential side!&nbsp; Pickering&rsquo;s secret was,
of course, his engagement to Miss Vernor; it was natural enough that
he should have been unable to bring himself to talk of it to Madame
Blumenthal.&nbsp; The simple sweetness of this young girl&rsquo;s face
had not faded from my memory; I could not rid myself of the suspicion
that in going further Pickering might fare much worse.&nbsp; Madame
Blumenthal&rsquo;s professions seemed a virtual promise to agree with
me, and, after some hesitation, I said that my friend had, in fact,
a substantial secret, and that perhaps I might do him a good turn by
putting her in possession of it.&nbsp; In as few words as possible I
told her that Pickering stood pledged by filial piety to marry a young
lady at Smyrna.&nbsp; She listened intently to my story; when I had
finished it there was a faint flush of excitement in each of her cheeks.&nbsp;
She broke out into a dozen exclamations of admiration and compassion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a wonderful tale&mdash;what a romantic situation!&nbsp;
No wonder poor Mr. Pickering seemed restless and unsatisfied; no wonder
he wished to put off the day of submission.&nbsp; And the poor little
girl at Smyrna, waiting there for the young Western prince like the
heroine of an Eastern tale!&nbsp; She would give the world to see her
photograph; did I think Mr. Pickering would show it to her?&nbsp; But
never fear; she would ask nothing indiscreet!&nbsp; Yes, it was a marvellous
story, and if she had invented it herself, people would have said it
was absurdly improbable.&rdquo;&nbsp; She left her seat and took several
turns about the room, smiling to herself, and uttering little German
cries of wonderment.&nbsp; Suddenly she stopped before the piano and
broke into a little laugh; the next moment she buried her face in the
great bouquet of roses.&nbsp; It was time I should go, but I was indisposed
to leave her without obtaining some definite assurance that, as far
as pity was concerned, she pitied the young girl at Smyrna more than
the young man at Homburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know what I wished in telling you this,&rdquo;
I said, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is evidently a charming creature, and
the best thing he can do is to marry her.&nbsp; I wished to interest
you in that view of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had taken one of the roses from the vase and was arranging it
in the front of her dress.&nbsp; Suddenly, looking up, &ldquo;Leave
it to me, leave it to me!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am interested!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And with her little blue-gemmed hand she tapped her forehead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am deeply interested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this I had to content myself.&nbsp; But more than once the
next day I repented of my zeal, and wondered whether a providence with
a white rose in her bosom might not turn out a trifle too human.&nbsp;
In the evening, at the Kursaal, I looked for Pickering, but he was not
visible, and I reflected that my revelation had not as yet, at any rate,
seemed to Madame Blumenthal a reason for prescribing a cooling-term
to his passion.&nbsp; Very late, as I was turning away, I saw him arrive&mdash;with
no small satisfaction, for I had determined to let him know immediately
in what way I had attempted to serve him.&nbsp; But he straightway passed
his arm through my own and led me off towards the gardens.&nbsp; I saw
that he was too excited to allow me to speak first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have burnt my ships!&rdquo; he cried, when we were out of
earshot of the crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have told her everything.&nbsp;
I have insisted that it&rsquo;s simple torture for me to wait with this
idle view of loving her less.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well enough for her to
ask it, but I feel strong enough now to override her reluctance.&nbsp;
I have cast off the millstone from round my neck.&nbsp; I care for nothing,
I know nothing, but that I love her with every pulse of my being&mdash;and
that everything else has been a hideous dream, from which she may wake
me into blissful morning with a single word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held him off at arm&rsquo;s-length and looked at him gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have told her, you mean, of your engagement to Miss Vernor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole story!&nbsp; I have given it up&mdash;I have thrown
it to the winds.&nbsp; I have broken utterly with the past.&nbsp; It
may rise in its grave and give me its curse, but it can&rsquo;t frighten
me now.&nbsp; I have a right to be happy, I have a right to be free,
I have a right not to bury myself alive.&nbsp; It was not <i>I</i> who
promised&mdash;I was not born then.&nbsp; I myself, my soul, my mind,
my option&mdash;all this is but a month old!&nbsp; Ah,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;if you knew the difference it makes&mdash;this having chosen
and broken and spoken!&nbsp; I am twice the man I was yesterday!&nbsp;
Yesterday I was afraid of her; there was a kind of mocking mystery of
knowledge and cleverness about her, which oppressed me in the midst
of my love.&nbsp; But now I am afraid of nothing but of being too happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood silent, to let him spend his eloquence.&nbsp; But he paused
a moment, and took off his hat and fanned himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
me perfectly understand,&rdquo; I said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
asked Madame Blumenthal to be your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wife of my intelligent choice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does she consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asks three days to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it four!&nbsp; She has known your secret since this morning.&nbsp;
I am bound to let you know I told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; cried Pickering, without apparent
resentment or surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a brilliant offer
for such a woman, and in spite of what I have at stake, I feel that
it would be brutal to press her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she say to your breaking your promise?&rdquo; I
asked in a moment.</p>
<p>Pickering was too much in love for false shame.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
tells me that she loves me too much to find courage to condemn me.&nbsp;
She agrees with me that I have a right to be happy.&nbsp; I ask no exemption
from the common law.&nbsp; What I claim is simply freedom to try to
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course I was puzzled; it was not in that fashion that I had expected
Madame Blumenthal to make use of my information.&nbsp; But the matter
now was quite out of my hands, and all I could do was to bid my companion
not work himself into a fever over either fortune.</p>
<p>The next day I had a visit from Niedermeyer, on whom, after our talk
at the opera, I had left a card.&nbsp; We gossiped a while, and at last
he said suddenly, &ldquo;By the way, I have a sequel to the history
of Clorinda.&nbsp; The major is at Homburg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems,&rdquo; said Niedermeyer, with a laugh, &ldquo;to
be chiefly occupied in sending flowers to Madame Blumenthal.&nbsp; That
is, I went with him the morning of his arrival to choose a nosegay,
and nothing would suit him but a small haystack of white roses.&nbsp;
I hope it was received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure you it was,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw
the lady fairly nestling her head in it.&nbsp; But I advise the major
not to build upon that.&nbsp; He has a rival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the soft young man of the other night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickering is soft, if you will, but his softness seems to
have served him.&nbsp; He has offered her everything, and she has not
yet refused it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had handed my visitor a cigar, and he
was puffing it in silence.&nbsp; At last he abruptly asked if I had
been introduced to Madame Blumenthal, and, on my affirmative, inquired
what I thought of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not tell you,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll call <i>me</i> soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knocked away his ashes, eyeing me askance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
noticed your friend about,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and even if you had
not told me, I should have known he was in love.&nbsp; After he has
left his adored, his face wears for the rest of the day the expression
with which he has risen from her feet, and more than once I have felt
like touching his elbow, as you would that of a man who has inadvertently
come into a drawing-room in his overshoes.&nbsp; You say he has offered
our friend everything; but, my dear fellow, he has not everything to
offer her.&nbsp; He evidently is as amiable as the morning, but the
lady has no taste for daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you Pickering is a very interesting fellow,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there it is!&nbsp; Has he not some story or other?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t he an orphan, or a natural child, or consumptive, or contingent
heir to great estates?&nbsp; She will read his little story to the end,
and close the book very tenderly and smooth down the cover; and then,
when he least expects it, she will toss it into the dusty limbo of her
other romances.&nbsp; She will let him dangle, but she will let him
drop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; I cried, with heat, &ldquo;if she does,
she will be a very unprincipled little creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Niedermeyer shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never said she
was a saint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrewd as I felt Niedermeyer to be, I was not prepared to take his
simple word for this event, and in the evening I received a communication
which fortified my doubts.&nbsp; It was a note from Pickering, and it
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Dear Friend&mdash;I have every hope of being
happy, but I am to go to Wiesbaden to learn my fate.&nbsp; Madame Blumenthal
goes thither this afternoon to spend a few days, and she allows me to
accompany her.&nbsp; Give me your good wishes; you shall hear of the
result.<br />
E. P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the diversions of Homburg for new-comers is to dine in rotation
at the different tables d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te.&nbsp; It so happened that,
a couple of days later, Niedermeyer took pot-luck at my hotel, and secured
a seat beside my own.&nbsp; As we took our places I found a letter on
my plate, and, as it was postmarked Wiesbaden, I lost no time in opening
it.&nbsp; It contained but three lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am happy&mdash;I am accepted&mdash;an hour ago.&nbsp;
I can hardly believe it&rsquo;s your poor friend<br />
E. P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I placed the note before Niedermeyer; not exactly in triumph, but
with the alacrity of all felicitous confutation.&nbsp; He looked at
it much longer than was needful to read it, stroking down his beard
gravely, and I felt it was not so easy to confute a pupil of the school
of Metternich.&nbsp; At last, folding the note and handing it back,
&ldquo;Has your friend mentioned Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s errand at
Wiesbaden?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look very wise.&nbsp; I give it up!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone there to make the major follow her.&nbsp; He went
by the next train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has the major, on his side, dropped you a line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not a letter-writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, pocketing my letter, &ldquo;with this
document in my hand I am bound to reserve my judgment.&nbsp; We will
have a bottle of Johannisberg, and drink to the triumph of virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a whole week more I heard nothing from Pickering&mdash;somewhat
to my surprise, and, as the days went by, not a little to my discomposure.&nbsp;
I had expected that his bliss would continue to overflow in brief bulletins,
and his silence was possibly an indication that it had been clouded.&nbsp;
At last I wrote to his hotel at Wiesbaden, but received no answer; whereupon,
as my next resource, I repaired to his former lodging at Homburg, where
I thought it possible he had left property which he would sooner or
later send for.&nbsp; There I learned that he had indeed just telegraphed
from Cologne for his luggage.&nbsp; To Cologne I immediately despatched
a line of inquiry as to his prosperity and the cause of his silence.&nbsp;
The next day I received three words in answer&mdash;a simple uncommented
request that I would come to him.&nbsp; I lost no time, and reached
him in the course of a few hours.&nbsp; It was dark when I arrived,
and the city was sheeted in a cold autumnal rain.&nbsp; Pickering had
stumbled, with an indifference which was itself a symptom of distress,
on a certain musty old Mainzerhof, and I found him sitting over a smouldering
fire in a vast dingy chamber which looked as if it had grown gray with
watching the <i>ennui</i> of ten generations of travellers.&nbsp; Looking
at him, as he rose on my entrance, I saw that he was in extreme tribulation.&nbsp;
He was pale and haggard; his face was five years older.&nbsp; Now, at
least, in all conscience, he had tasted of the cup of life!&nbsp; I
was anxious to know what had turned it so suddenly to bitterness; but
I spared him all importunate curiosity, and let him take his time.&nbsp;
I accepted tacitly his tacit confession of distress, and we made for
a while a feeble effort to discuss the picturesqueness of Cologne.&nbsp;
At last he rose and stood a long time looking into the fire, while I
slowly paced the length of the dusky room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, as I came back; &ldquo;I wanted knowledge,
and I certainly know something I didn&rsquo;t a month ago.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And herewith, calmly and succinctly enough, as if dismay had worn itself
out, he related the history of the foregoing days.&nbsp; He touched
lightly on details; he evidently never was to gush as freely again as
he had done during the prosperity of his suit.&nbsp; He had been accepted
one evening, as explicitly as his imagination could desire, and had
gone forth in his rapture and roamed about till nearly morning in the
gardens of the Conversation-house, taking the stars and the perfumes
of the summer night into his confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is worth it
all, almost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have been wound up for an hour
to that celestial pitch.&nbsp; No man, I am sure, can ever know it but
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next morning he had repaired to Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s
lodging and had been met, to his amazement, by a naked refusal to see
him.&nbsp; He had strode about for a couple of hours&mdash;in another
mood&mdash;and then had returned to the charge.&nbsp; The servant handed
him a three-cornered note; it contained these words: &ldquo;Leave me
alone to-day; I will give you ten minutes to-morrow evening.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Of the next thirty-six hours he could give no coherent account, but
at the appointed time Madame Blumenthal had received him.&nbsp; Almost
before she spoke there had come to him a sense of the depth of his folly
in supposing he knew her.&nbsp; &ldquo;One has heard all one&rsquo;s
days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of people removing the mask; it&rsquo;s
one of the stock phrases of romance.&nbsp; Well, there she stood with
her mask in her hand.&nbsp; Her face,&rdquo; he went on gravely, after
a pause&mdash;&ldquo;her face was horrible!&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;I give
you ten minutes,&rdquo; she had said, pointing to the clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make
your scene, tear your hair, brandish your dagger!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
had sat down and folded her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a joke,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dead earnest; let us have it over.&nbsp;
You are dismissed&mdash;have you nothing to say?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
stammered some frantic demand for an explanation; and she had risen
and come near him, looking at him from head to feet, very pale, and
evidently more excited than she wished him to see.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
done with you!&rdquo; she said, with a smile; &ldquo;you ought to have
done with me!&nbsp; It has all been delightful, but there are excellent
reasons why it should come to an end.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have been playing
a part, then,&rdquo; he had gasped out; &ldquo;you never cared for me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; till I knew you; till I saw how far you would go.&nbsp;
But now the story&rsquo;s finished; we have reached the <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i>.&nbsp;
We will close the book and be good friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To see
how far I would go?&rdquo; he had repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;You led me
on, meaning all the while to do <i>this</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I led
you on, if you will.&nbsp; I received your visits, in season and out!&nbsp;
Sometimes they were very entertaining; sometimes they bored me fearfully.&nbsp;
But you were such a very curious case of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;of
sincerity, that I determined to take good and bad together.&nbsp; I
wanted to make you commit yourself unmistakably.&nbsp; I should have
preferred not to bring you to this place; but that too was necessary.&nbsp;
Of course I can&rsquo;t marry you; I can do better.&nbsp; So can you,
for that matter; thank your fate for it.&nbsp; You have thought wonders
of me for a month, but your good-humour wouldn&rsquo;t last.&nbsp; I
am too old and too wise; you are too young and too foolish.&nbsp; It
seems to me that I have been very good to you; I have entertained you
to the top of your bent, and, except perhaps that I am a little brusque
just now, you have nothing to complain of.&nbsp; I would have let you
down more gently if I could have taken another month to it; but circumstances
have forced my hand.&nbsp; Abuse me, curse me, if you like.&nbsp; I
will make every allowance!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pickering listened to all this
intently enough to perceive that, as if by some sudden natural cataclysm,
the ground had broken away at his feet, and that he must recoil.&nbsp;
He turned away in dumb amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
I seemed to be taking it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but she seemed really
to desire&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;something in the way of
reproach and vituperation.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t, in that way,
have uttered a syllable.&nbsp; I was sickened; I wanted to get away
into the air&mdash;to shake her off and come to my senses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have
you nothing, nothing, nothing to say?&rsquo; she cried, as if she were
disappointed, while I stood with my hand on the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t
I treated you to talk enough?&rsquo; I believed I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
will write to me then, when you get home?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I think
not,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Six months hence, I fancy, you will
come and see me!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
a confession of stupidity,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It means
that, even on reflection, you will never understand the philosophy of
my conduct.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; seemed so
strange that I verily believe I smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have given you
all that you gave me,&rsquo; she went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your passion
was an affair of the head.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I only wish you had told
me sooner that you considered it so!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; And I
went my way.&nbsp; The next day I came down the Rhine.&nbsp; I sat all
day on the boat, not knowing where I was going, where to get off.&nbsp;
I was in a kind of ague of terror; it seemed to me I had seen something
infernal.&nbsp; At last I saw the cathedral towers here looming over
the city.&nbsp; They seemed to say something to me, and when the boat
stopped, I came ashore.&nbsp; I have been here a week.&nbsp; I have
not slept at night&mdash;and yet it has been a week of rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that he was in a fair way to recover, and that his
own philosophy, if left to take its time, was adequate to the occasion.&nbsp;
After his story was once told I referred to his grievance but once&mdash;that
evening, later, as we were about to separate for the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suffer
me to say that there was some truth in <i>her</i> account of your relations,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were using her intellectually, and all the
while, without your knowing it, she was using you.&nbsp; It was diamond
cut diamond.&nbsp; Her needs were the more superficial, and she got
tired of the game first.&rdquo;&nbsp; He frowned and turned uneasily
away, but without contradicting me.&nbsp; I waited a few moments, to
see if he would remember, before we parted, that he had a claim to make
upon me.&nbsp; But he seemed to have forgotten it.</p>
<p>The next day we strolled about the picturesque old city, and of course,
before long, went into the cathedral.&nbsp; Pickering said little; he
seemed intent upon his own thoughts.&nbsp; He sat down beside a pillar
near a chapel, in front of a gorgeous window, and, leaving him to his
meditations, I wandered through the church.&nbsp; When I came back I
saw he had something to say.&nbsp; But before he had spoken I laid my
hand on his shoulder and looked at him with a significant smile.&nbsp;
He slowly bent his head and dropped his eyes, with a mixture of assent
and humility.&nbsp; I drew forth from where it had lain untouched for
a month the letter he had given me to keep, placed it silently on his
knee, and left him to deal with it alone.</p>
<p>Half an hour later I returned to the same place, but he had gone,
and one of the sacristans, hovering about and seeing me looking for
Pickering, said he thought he had left the church.&nbsp; I found him
in his gloomy chamber at the inn, pacing slowly up and down.&nbsp; I
should doubtless have been at a loss to say just what effect I expected
the letter from Smyrna to produce; but his actual aspect surprised me.&nbsp;
He was flushed, excited, a trifle irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you have read your letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is proper I should tell you what is in it,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I gave it to you a month ago, I did my friends injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called it a &lsquo;summons,&rsquo; I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a great fool!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a release!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From everything!&nbsp; The letter, of course, is from Mr.
Vernor.&nbsp; He desires to let me know at the earliest moment that
his daughter, informed for the first time a week before of what had
been expected of her, positively refuses to be bound by the contract
or to assent to my being bound.&nbsp; She had been given a week to reflect,
and had spent it in inconsolable tears.&nbsp; She had resisted every
form of persuasion! from compulsion, writes Mr. Vernor, he naturally
shrinks.&nbsp; The young lady considers the arrangement &lsquo;horrible.&rsquo;&nbsp;
After accepting her duties cut and dried all her life, she pretends
at last to have a taste of her own.&nbsp; I confess I am surprised;
I had been given to believe that she was stupidly submissive, and would
remain so to the end of the chapter.&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; She
has insisted on my being formally dismissed, and her father intimates
that in case of non-compliance she threatens him with an attack of brain
fever.&nbsp; Mr. Vernor condoles with me handsomely, and lets me know
that the young lady&rsquo;s attitude has been a great shock to his nerves.&nbsp;
He adds that he will not aggravate such regret as I may do him the honour
to entertain, by any allusions to his daughter&rsquo;s charms and to
the magnitude of my loss, and he concludes with the hope that, for the
comfort of all concerned, I may already have amused my fancy with other
&lsquo;views.&rsquo;&nbsp; He reminds me in a postscript that, in spite
of this painful occurrence, the son of his most valued friend will always
be a welcome visitor at his house.&nbsp; I am free, he observes; I have
my life before me; he recommends an extensive course of travel.&nbsp;
Should my wanderings lead me to the East, he hopes that no false embarrassment
will deter me from presenting myself at Smyrna.&nbsp; He can promise
me at least a friendly reception.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very polite letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polite as the letter was, Pickering seemed to find no great exhilaration
in having this famous burden so handsomely lifted from his spirit.&nbsp;
He began to brood over his liberation in a manner which you might have
deemed proper to a renewed sense of bondage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bad news,&rdquo;
he had called his letter originally; and yet, now that its contents
proved to be in flat contradiction to his foreboding, there was no impulsive
voice to reverse the formula and declare the news was good.&nbsp; The
wings of impulse in the poor fellow had of late been terribly clipped.&nbsp;
It was an obvious reflection, of course, that if he had not been so
stiffly certain of the matter a month before, and had gone through the
form of breaking Mr. Vernor&rsquo;s seal, he might have escaped the
purgatory of Madame Blumenthal&rsquo;s sub-acid blandishments.&nbsp;
But I left him to moralise in private; I had no desire, as the phrase
is, to rub it in.&nbsp; My thoughts, moreover, were following another
train; I was saying to myself that if to those gentle graces of which
her young visage had offered to my fancy the blooming promise, Miss
Vernor added in this striking measure the capacity for magnanimous action,
the amendment to my friend&rsquo;s career had been less happy than the
rough draught.&nbsp; Presently, turning about, I saw him looking at
the young lady&rsquo;s photograph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, now,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I have no right to keep it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And before
I could ask for another glimpse of it, he had thrust it into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to be saying it just now,&rdquo; I observed after
a while, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Miss Vernor were a charming
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and find out,&rdquo; he answered, gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
coast is clear.&nbsp; My part is to forget her,&rdquo; he presently
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;It ought not to be hard.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you
think,&rdquo; he went on suddenly, &ldquo;that for a poor fellow who
asked nothing of fortune but leave to sit down in a quiet corner, it
has been rather a cruel pushing about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cruel indeed, I declared, and he certainly had the right to demand
a clean page on the book of fate and a fresh start.&nbsp; Mr. Vernor&rsquo;s
advice was sound; he should amuse himself with a long journey.&nbsp;
If it would be any comfort to him, I would go with him on his way.&nbsp;
Pickering assented without enthusiasm; he had the embarrassed look of
a man who, having gone to some cost to make a good appearance in a drawing-room,
should find the door suddenly slammed in his face.&nbsp; We started
on our journey, however, and little by little his enthusiasm returned.&nbsp;
He was too capable of enjoying fine things to remain permanently irresponsive,
and after a fortnight spent among pictures and monuments and antiquities,
I felt that I was seeing him for the first time in his best and healthiest
mood.&nbsp; He had had a fever, and then he had had a chill; the pendulum
had swung right and left in a manner rather trying to the machine; but
now, at last, it was working back to an even, natural beat.&nbsp; He
recovered in a measure the generous eloquence with which he had fanned
his flame at Homburg, and talked about things with something of the
same passionate freshness.&nbsp; One day when I was laid up at the inn
at Bruges with a lame foot, he came home and treated me to a rhapsody
about a certain meek-faced virgin of Hans Memling, which seemed to me
sounder sense than his compliments to Madame Blumenthal.&nbsp; He had
his dull days and his sombre moods&mdash;hours of irresistible retrospect;
but I let them come and go without remonstrance, because I fancied they
always left him a trifle more alert and resolute.&nbsp; One evening,
however, he sat hanging his head in so doleful a fashion that I took
the bull by the horns and told him he had by this time surely paid his
debt to penitence, and that he owed it to himself to banish that woman
for ever from his thoughts.</p>
<p>He looked up, staring; and then with a deep blush&mdash;&ldquo;That
woman?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was not thinking of Madame Blumenthal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I gave another construction to his melancholy.&nbsp; Taking
him with his hopes and fears, at the end of six weeks of active observation
and keen sensation, Pickering was as fine a fellow as need be.&nbsp;
We made our way down to Italy and spent a fortnight at Venice.&nbsp;
There something happened which I had been confidently expecting; I had
said to myself that it was merely a question of time.&nbsp; We had passed
the day at Torcello, and came floating back in the glow of the sunset,
with measured oar-strokes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am well on the way,&rdquo;
Pickering said; &ldquo;I think I will go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had not spoken for an hour, and I naturally asked him, Where?&nbsp;
His answer was delayed by our getting into the Piazzetta.&nbsp; I stepped
ashore first and then turned to help him.&nbsp; As he took my hand he
met my eyes, consciously, and it came.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Smyrna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A couple of days later he started.&nbsp; I had risked the conjecture
that Miss Vernor was a charming creature, and six months afterwards
he wrote me that I was right.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
